@mainpage Data Structures.
This documentation will provide you the necessary information to use the different types of data structures present in the 
library

@section Description
Data Structures are a way to store, access and manipulate data. Based on the requirements of the user, data structures are designed in such a 
way that they are simple, efficient and easy to maintain. This library consists of simple implementation of basic data structures in C language.

@subsection Stack
Stack is based on First In First Out concept. The library contains dynamic implementaion of array based integer stack.

Header file here: @ref stack.h

Source file here: @ref stack.c

@subsection Queue
Queue is based on Last In First Out concept. The library contains dynamic implementation of array based integer queue.

Header file here: @ref queue.h

Source file here: @ref queue.c

@subsection Linked List
Linked list is a linear data structures which is based on nodes. The library contains the XOR linked list. A XOR linked list is a list which
contains the XOR of address of both previous and next node and provides access to both ways. However to move forward in one direction, one must have
the address of present node along with the previous node.
